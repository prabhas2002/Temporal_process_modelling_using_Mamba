# Temporal Point Process Modeling with Mamba-TP: Enhanced Performance over THP

This repository contains the implementation of a novel approach for temporal point process modeling using **Mamba** as the backbone. The method, named **Mamba-TP**, modifies the architecture to improve performance compared to the Transformer Hawkes Process (THP). 

The results demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy and efficiency across multiple datasets. The evaluation includes detailed comparisons with THP, along with visualizations of the results.

## **Features**
- Implements **Mamba-TP**, a modified Mamba-based framework for temporal point processes.
- Benchmarks performance against **Transformer Hawkes Process (THP)**.
- Supports multiple temporal point process datasets.
- Includes comprehensive results and visualizations in `results.ipynb`.
